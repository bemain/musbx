## Collecting and Using Your Data

### Types of Data Collected

#### Usage Data

Usage Data is collected automatically when using the Service.  
Usage Data may include information such as Your Device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address), unique device identifiers, the type of mobile device You use, Your mobile operating system, and other diagnostic data. This data is used for analytics purposes to help me understand how users interact with the app and to identify areas for improvement.

#### User-Provided Content

When You use the recording feature or upload a song from Your device, this audio data is stored on Your device. **At Your explicit request**, this audio file will be transferred to a secure server. This is done only to enable certain features, such as demixing and chord analysis. The content of these files is not used for any other purpose and is not shared with third parties.

#### Permissions and Data Collected from Your Device

The Musician's Toolbox app may request permissions to access certain features on Your Device. These permissions are **entirely optional** and the app remains functional without them. Data collected through these permissions is **not transmitted** off Your device unless you initiate the transfer of user-provided content, e.g. by using the demixing tool of the Songs player.

* **Microphone:** Access to the microphone is requested to enable the tuner functionality and to allow you to record audio.  
* **External Files:** Access to external files is requested to allow you to upload songs or audio files from your device into the app.  
* **Notifications:** Permission for notifications may be requested to send you updates or information about the app's features.

### Use of Your Data

I may use Your data for the following purposes:

* **To provide and maintain my Service**, including to monitor the usage of the Application and provide features such as demixing.  
* **For business transfers:** I may use Your information to evaluate or conduct a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of my assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which Your data is among the assets transferred.  
* **For other purposes:** I may use Your information for other purposes, such as data analysis, identifying usage trends, determining the effectiveness of my promotional campaigns and to evaluate and improve the Service, products, and Your experience.

I may share Your information in the following situations:

* **With Service Providers:** I may share Your information with Service Providers, such as analytics services, to monitor and analyze the use of the Service.

* **With Your consent:** I may disclose Your information for any other purpose with Your consent.

## Security of Your Data

The security of Your data is important to me, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While I strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Your data, I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Links to Other Websites

The Service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by me. If You click on a third party link, You will be directed to that third party's site. I strongly advise You to review the Privacy Policy of every site You visit.  
I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

I may update My Privacy Policy from time to time. The new Privacy Policy will be posted on this page.  
You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
