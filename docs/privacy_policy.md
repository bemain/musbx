Usage Data is collected automatically when using the Service.  

Usage Data may include information such as Your Device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address), unique device identifiers, the type of mobile device You use, Your mobile operating system, and other diagnostic data. This data is used for analytics purposes to help me understand how users interact with the app and to identify areas for improvement.

#### User-Provided Content

When You use the recording feature or upload a song from Your device, this audio data is stored on Your device. **At Your explicit request**, this audio file will be transferred to a secure server. This is done only to enable certain features, such as demixing and chord analysis. The content of these files is not used for any other purpose and is not shared with third parties.

#### Permissions and Data Collected from Your Device

The Musician's Toolbox app may request permissions to access certain features on Your Device. These permissions are **entirely optional** and the app remains functional without them. Data collected through these permissions is **not transmitted** off Your device unless you initiate the transfer of user-provided content, e.g. by using the demixing tool of the Songs player.

* **Microphone:** Access to the microphone is requested to enable the tuner functionality and to allow you to record audio.  
* **External Files:** Access to external files is requested to allow you to upload songs or audio files from your device into the app.

* **For other purposes:** I may use Your information for other purposes, such as data analysis, identifying usage trends, determining the effectiveness of my promotional campaigns and to evaluate and improve the Service, products, and Your experience.

I may share Your information in the following situations:

**I do not assume any legal responsibility or liability for the content You search for or access, nor for the intellectual property rights or legality of that content.** The content is owned and provided by the third-party websites. You are solely and personally responsible for the use of this search functionality, Your search queries, and how You use the content retrieved through the Application.

The Service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by me. If You click on a third party link, You will be directed to that third party's site. I strongly advise You to review the Privacy Policy of every site You visit.  

I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.
