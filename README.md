## Git naming

### Commits
This project follows (since Sep 25 2023) the [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification for naming commits. Here follows a short summary of that specification.

A commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[(scope)]: <description>

[body]

[footer(s)]
```

A commit that has a footer `BREAKING CHANGE`:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change. 
The footer `Fixes <issue number>` can be used to reference a GitHub issue.

[Commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/) is a command line tool that can be used to assist in creating commits that follows the Conventional commits specification. 

### Branches
A branch should be named as follows:

```
feat/[area]/[issue reference]/<description>
```

Example `area`s: `demixer`, `tuner`, `songs`.

The `description` should use kebab-case.

Here's a complete example: 
```
feat/songs/issue72/configure-audio-session
```
